AcciSafe is a react native modile application that enables the user to report accidents to the nearest hospitals.
The main aim is to create an ecosystem of all users registered on the app so that it is easy to identify,conatct emergency people and report. <br> <br> 
We may have noticed many a times people just walk pass from the accident scene to avoid inconveince. 
Due to this a lot of time is wasted to inform the ambulance to arrive.
Using our application anyone can just click an image of the accident, put in the vehicle number plate text 
and report it. Our system is capable to get the emergency contact of the user who has met with the accident, since every user while registering fill's his/her data.
Apart from this it also identifies the users location and seraches the nearest hospitals and notifies the selected hospital.
